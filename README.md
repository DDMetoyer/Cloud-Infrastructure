# Cloud-Infrastructure

Welcome to the **Cloud Infrastructure** repository — a collection of hands-on projects focused on deploying, configuring, and securing infrastructure in the cloud. These labs reflect real-world scenarios that integrate system administration, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and DevOps practices.

I'm **Devante**, a Cybersecurity professional and Cyber Operations senior at the University of Arizona, specializing in Cyber Engineering. This repository showcases my applied skills in managing cloud infrastructure across platforms like AWS, with a strong emphasis on secure deployment, automation, and infrastructure hardening.
